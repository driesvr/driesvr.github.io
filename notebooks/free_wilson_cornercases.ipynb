        "In this notebook we'll try to address some corner cases that may come up when running Free Wilson Analyses with RDKit. The base script is is taken directly from Pat Wilson's excellent Free-Wilson Analysis notebook, and we'll be making just a few modifications to remedy issues with specific types of molecules. I've taken the liberty of condensing Pat's notebook to the bare essentials needed to run FWA, I would consider the full notebook which you can find [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials/blob/main/sar_analysis/free_wilson.ipynb) to be essential reading for cheminformaticians."
